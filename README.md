# November 2019 git workshop

I am looking for help! I'd like as many people as possible to make a small pull request, commiting a file where:

* The filename is your github username
* The text of the file is a short bio

Note that this is in public. Your bio does not need to be factual. You might be the president of Irkmanistan, a Nobel prize winner for your work in Windows 3.1 Solitaire, or whatever you see fit. 

##Here's my comments:

Marzipan chocolate bar tart cotton candy bear claw dragée halvah marshmallow pastry. Croissant brownie cotton candy sweet roll. Dragée apple pie pie.

Gummi bears pastry macaroon soufflé. Caramels candy cake jujubes. Ice cream brownie cotton candy icing cookie tiramisu gingerbread.

Sesame snaps sesame snaps icing tiramisu. Bonbon sweet roll pie sesame snaps tootsie roll carrot cake icing oat cake. Wafer tiramisu pudding wafer marshmallow.
