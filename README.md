# November 2019 git workshop

I am looking for help! I'd like as many people as possible to make a small pull request, commiting a file where:

* The filename is your github username
* The text of the file is a short bio

Note that this is in public. Your bio does not need to be factual. You might be the president of Irkmanistan, a Nobel prize winner for your work in Windows 3.1 Solitaire, or whatever you see fit. 

Here is a change.
